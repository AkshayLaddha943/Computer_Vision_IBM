A digital image can be interpreted as a rectangular array of numbers. An image is comprised of rectangular grid of blocks called pixels which are denotes as intensity values.

Digital images have an intensity value between 0<=intensity_val<=255

OpenCV differs from PIL in a way that the order of channel arrays is different with PIL having RGB and OpenCV having the order of BGR

Within Image manipulation, we perform -

 * **Flipping images** refers to changing the orientation of the image by interchanging the column and row index values
 * **Cropping images** refers to cutting out part of image and throwing out the rest
 * **Changing Image pixels** refers to changing the intensity values of image
